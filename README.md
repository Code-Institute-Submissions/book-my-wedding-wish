Welcome dear reader,

This is a new project I've been working on, mainly focusing on the following languages and technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Python
- Flask framework
- MongoDB
- Pymongo

The project is deployed to Heroku after major changes.
At the moment I am still working on the backend and site architecture logic but you can already interact with the web app [here](https://book-my-wedding-wish.herokuapp.com/).

Topic: No more useless wedding gifts! Create a free wedding registry for your wedding guests.
Send the wishlist preview to your guests and let them book the presents they want to buy you themselves.
