# BOOK MY WEDDING WISH - Online Wedding Registry For Your Guests

Code Institute - Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development

BOOK MY WEDDING WISH helps you create your dream wedding registry for your friends and family.
Since it can be difficult, and often awkward, to communicate to your guests what you need or would like to receive,
Book My Wedding Wish allows you to create an online gift wishlist that you can share with your guests - for free.

The primary purpose of this web app is to help the soon-to-be married couple with informing their wedding attendees what they 
would prefer to receive as presents. Instead of talking to each guest separately, struggling with giving present suggestions 
that would fit a guest's budget, getting the same present twice or end up not liking a present at all - Book My Wedding Wish 
aims to help the happy couple by allowing them to create an online place where guests can choose among the presents the couple wishes
to receive.

As the guests also struggle with choosing a present for the happy couple - which is often quite expensive - this online 
wedding gift wishlist helps them with deciding on what to buy while they can be sure the present will be greatly appreaciated. 
Therefore, the secondary purpose of this app is to provide a simple overview of desired wedding presents and an easy booking process.
