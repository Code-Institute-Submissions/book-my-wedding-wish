# BOOK MY WEDDING WISH - Online Wedding Registry For Your Guests

Code Institute - Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development

BOOK MY WEDDING WISH helps you create your dream wedding registry for your friends and family.
Since it can be difficult, and often awkward, to communicate to your guests what you need or would like to receive,
Book My Wedding Wish allows you to create an online gift wishlist that you can share with your guests - for free.

The primary purpose of this web app is to help the soon-to-be married couple with informing their wedding attendees what they 
would prefer to receive as presents. Instead of talking to each guest separately, struggling with giving present suggestions 
that would fit a guest's budget, getting the same present twice or end up not liking a present at all - Book My Wedding Wish 
aims to help the happy couple by allowing them to create an online place where guests can choose among the presents the couple wishes
to receive.

As the guests also struggle with choosing a present for the newlyweds - which is often quite expensive - this online 
wedding gift wishlist helps them with deciding on what to buy while they can be sure the present will be greatly appreaciated. 
Therefore, the secondary purpose of this app is to provide a simple overview of desired wedding presents and an easy booking process.

## UX

It is no secret wedding planning can be quite stressful and time-consuming. According to [Zola's survey](https://www.zola.com/blog/wedding-planning/science-wedding-planning-stressful/) 
on wedding planning, 96% of couples find wedding planning stressful. In fact, 86% of respondents suffered from up to three stress-induced symptoms, 
including skin breakouts, hair loss, insomnia, headaches, etc. On the other hand, 
[DailyMail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2394473/Thats-ungrateful-82-PER-CENT-newlyweds-admit-selling-wedding-gifts-eBay.html) 
reports that "42% of guests admit they find buying wedding gifts stressful" while 10% of invited guests "declined invitation due to finding 
gift-buying process unpleasant." Despite the effort guests put into choosing a present, DailyMail's research has also shown that 20% of guests 
expect their gifts to be left unused, returned or sold while 82% of newlyweds actually do end up selling their presents on eBay and similar sites.

The psychology of giving wedding gifts is truly fascinating. In NPR's [interview with Shankar Vedantam](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483426485/new-study-explores-psychology-of-giving-wedding-gifts?t=1599418748672), 
who did a research on this topic, Shankar says the tensions are produced from the fact that we want the gift to please the people getting married but 
at the same time, the gift should reflect well on us. One of the reasons why guests deviate from buying off the wedding registry is that it doesn't 
feel special enough. It is the close friends that normally deviate from the registry, saying that "they're doing it because they know what we really 
want more than we know ourselves." It doesn't seem like those 82% newlyweds who end up selling their wedding presents on eBay would agree.

### Conclusion of the Research

For a life event that is expected to be full of joy and harmony, the reasearch shows otherwise for majority of the participants - newlyweds and guests both.
The wedding planning is already stressful enough and the research shows the happy couple doesn't seem to be as happy with the presents despite the 
availability of wedding registries. This project follows the general UX of other online wedding registries such as [MyRegistry](https://www.myregistry.com/) 
and [Zola](https://www.zola.com/) with an important twist - a present is submitted with a personal note from the couple explaining why they want 
exactly this present. This might help the guests to realise the importance of the item on the list and encourage them to stick to the list.
