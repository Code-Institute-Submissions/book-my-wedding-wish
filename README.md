# BOOK MY WEDDING WISH - Online Wedding Registry For Your Guests

Code Institute - Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development

BOOK MY WEDDING WISH helps you create your dream wedding registry for your friends and family.
Since it can be difficult, and often awkward, to communicate to your guests what you need or would like to receive,
Book My Wedding Wish allows you to create an online gift wishlist that you can share with your guests - for free.

The primary purpose of this web app is to help the soon-to-be married couple with informing their wedding attendees what they 
would prefer to receive as presents. Instead of talking to each guest separately, struggling with giving present suggestions 
that would fit a guest's budget, getting the same present twice or end up not liking a present at all - Book My Wedding Wish 
aims to help the happy couple by allowing them to create an online place where guests can choose among the presents the couple wishes
to receive.

As the guests also struggle with choosing a present for the newlyweds - which is often quite expensive - this online 
wedding gift wishlist helps them with deciding on what to buy while they can be sure the present will be greatly appreaciated. 
Therefore, the secondary purpose of this app is to provide a simple overview of desired wedding presents and an easy booking process.

## UX

It is no secret wedding planning can be quite stressful and time-consuming. According to [Zola's survey](https://www.zola.com/blog/wedding-planning/science-wedding-planning-stressful/) 
on wedding planning, 96% of couples find wedding planning stressful. In fact, 86% of respondents suffered from up to three stress-induced symptoms, 
including skin breakouts, hair loss, insomnia, headaches, etc. On the other hand, 
[DailyMail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2394473/Thats-ungrateful-82-PER-CENT-newlyweds-admit-selling-wedding-gifts-eBay.html) 
reports that "42% of guests admit they find buying wedding gifts stressful" while 10% of invited guests "declined invitation due to finding 
gift-buying process unpleasant." Despite the effort guests put into choosing a present, DailyMail's research has also shown that 20% of guests 
expect their gifts to be left unused, returned or sold while 82% of newlyweds actually do end up selling their presents on eBay and similar sites.

The psychology of giving wedding gifts is truly fascinating. In NPR's [interview with Shankar Vedantam](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483426485/new-study-explores-psychology-of-giving-wedding-gifts?t=1599418748672), 
who did a research on this topic, Shankar says the tensions are produced from the fact that we want the gift to please the people getting married but 
at the same time, the gift should reflect well on us. One of the reasons why guests deviate from buying off the wedding registry is that it doesn't 
feel special enough. It is the close friends that normally deviate from the registry, saying that "they're doing it because they know what we really 
want more than we know ourselves." It doesn't seem like those 82% newlyweds who end up selling their wedding presents on eBay would agree.

### Conclusion of the Research

For a life event that is expected to be full of joy and harmony, the reasearch shows otherwise for majority of the participants - newlyweds and guests both.
The wedding planning is already stressful enough and the research shows the happy couple doesn't seem to be as happy with the presents despite the 
availability of wedding registries. This project follows the general UX of other online wedding registries such as [MyRegistry](https://www.myregistry.com/) 
and [Zola](https://www.zola.com/) with an important twist - a present is submitted with a personal note from the couple explaining why they want 
exactly this present. This might help the guests to realise the importance of the item on the list and encourage them to stick to the list.

### Customer Goals

The primary customers for this app are the wshlist owners, however, since guests are interactng with the wishlist as well, they can be considered as 
the secondary customers.

As a wishlist owner...

* I need to communicate well to my guests which presents I'd like to receive so that I don't get something I don't want or need.
* I want to save my gift wishlist online so that I can easily share it with the guests.
* I want to be able to see which gifts will be bought so that I can add more if I have to.
* I want to have control over the presents I put on the wishlist so that I know the guests have the updated list.
* I want to be able to add a personal message to each present so the guests know why I want that particular present.
* I want to have a variety of presents on the wishlist so that everyone can pick something it fits their budget best.

As a wedding guest...

* I need help with deciding what to buy to the happy couple because the buying process is stressful for me.
* I need to be sure the couple will love the present I buy so that I don't feel like I've wasted my money.
* I want to know that other guests will not buy the same product so that the couple doesn't get the same present twice.
* I want to buy a present that I am also happy with so that I feel like I'm giving something unique or special.

### Business Goals

This project is mostly focusing on the end-user needs, such as wishlist owners and their wedding guests. The main goal was to make sure the web app is 
suitable and useful for them. However, the business idea for this app could follow the affiliate business model most online weddng registries follow. 
The feature related to business goals can be implemented in the future product releases.

As a business owner...

* I want to be able to analyse what users are buying so I can earn by selling data to 3rd parties.
* I want to see which brands people are buying from so that I could start brand partnership with them.
* I want the user to have an interface they will love because they will want to come back.
* I want the users to be able to connect to the product online so that the chances of buying itand earning from it's commision are higher.
